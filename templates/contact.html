            This thing was made by <a href="https://github.com/blakegilmore">Blake Gilmore</a>. It was written mostly in Javascript.
            It calls on things other people wrote in Javascript, including <a href="https://github.com/cwilso/pitchdetect">a pitch detector from Chris Wilson, </a>
            <a href="https://github.com/zirafa/pushtape-player.js">an audio player from zirafa</a>, the Sound Manager 2 API, and the web's built-in API for audio.
