# VoiceCoach
A web app that helps you tune your voice and practice your scales, no need for a piano or a teacher.

# Demo
Visit https://voicecoachdemo.herokuapp.com to see the app in action.

# Features
- pitch detector & matcher
    - check if you're on pitch; see how closely you match a sample audio track or Mariah Carey
- routine builder
  - create and save different routines for different practice situations (e.g. you're tired and your voice is sore, so you choose a shorter routine)
- player
  - play your audio routine, jumping around within a scale and from scale to scale with ease.

# Props
This app builds upon a pitch detector created by [Chris Wilson](https://github.com/cwilso/pitchdetect) as well as an audio player by [zirafa](https://github.com/zirafa/pushtape-player.js/blob/master/README.md).
